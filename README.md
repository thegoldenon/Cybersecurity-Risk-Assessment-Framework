# RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
#  Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Framework for Small E-commerce Businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria

## Objective
This project aims to design a cybersecurity framework for Nigerian SMEs in e-commerce, focusing on protecting customer data, ensuring payment security, and complying with regulations like NDPR, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.

It addresses challenges such as limited resources, lack of cybersecurity expertise, and rising threats like phishing and data breaches. The phased approach will:

Strengthen data security
Secure websites and payment gateways
Implement continuous monitoring and compliance
Enhance resilience against evolving cyber threats
This framework empowers small e-commerce businesses to operate securely while maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance.

### Skills Learned from this Project
Risk Assessment & Management: Identifying and prioritizing cybersecurity risks for small e-commerce businesses.
Cybersecurity Planning: Designing security architecture with encryption, firewalls, WAF, 2FA, and tokenization.
Regulatory Compliance: Implementing NDPR, PCI-DSS, and GDPR requirements for data protection.
Incident Response: Creating and testing response plans for breaches and phishing, including post-incident reviews.
Continuous Monitoring: Utilizing SIEM tools and vulnerability scanning for ongoing threat detection and improvement.
Team Collaboration: Coordinating IT, security, and vendors for effective security implementation and task management.

## Steps followed in this project
Phase 1: Scope Definition
Identify the business environment, focusing on Nigerian e-commerce SMEs, and tailor regulatory frameworks (NDPR, PCI-DSS, GDPR) to their needs.

Phase 2: Inventory Critical Assets
List key digital assets (customer data, payment gateways, APIs), prioritizing them based on business value and risk.

Phase 3: Risk Evaluation
Assess risks like phishing, malware, and API vulnerabilities, ranking them by likelihood and impact.

Phase 4: Risk Mitigation
Create a plan with security controls like encryption, WAF, access controls, and employee training to reduce vulnerabilities.

Phase 5: Implementation
Assign tasks, set timelines, and track progress through weekly check-ins to ensure smooth deployment.

Phase 6: Monitoring & Improvement
Use SIEM tools for continuous monitoring, conduct drills for incident response, and perform regular audits to maintain compliance and improve security.
